-- Recursos Build 03C — Certification import batch 3/7 (10 records)
-- Source: data/recursos/verified/scc-community-resource-guide-2023-ready-for-import.json
-- Records 21..30 of 65 (sorted verificationPriority asc, candidateId asc).
--
-- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Resources are upserted by slug (unique); review rows are
-- upserted by candidate_id (unique). A second execution leaves row counts unchanged.
-- No DELETE / TRUNCATE / DROP / ALTER. Current researched facts are authoritative and
-- always overwrite any prior value on conflict (including for rows already promoted
-- during the earlier pilot data load).
